# Alejandro's dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles.
*This work is still in progress as it is a constantly changing project.*
Right now I'm working on a 'per distro' installation. I tend to switch my Linux installation quite a lot but for the moment I'm mostly running Arch on my personal PC and fedora/ubuntu for work related stuff so... mainly I'll use selectors for those 3 distros. These selectors will be mainly used for configuring and executing apt/dnf/pacman commands.

### Software included
    -   aws cli
    -   aws-iam-authenticator
    -   terraform
    -   kubectl
    -   kubens
    -   kubectx
## Installation

In order to set up my configuration files, in case of Arch Linux simply use the following command:
```
chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
